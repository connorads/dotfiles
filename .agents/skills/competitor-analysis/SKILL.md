   **Your Site**: [URL]
   
   ## Executive Summary
   
   [2-3 paragraph overview of key findings and recommendations]
   
   ## Competitive Landscape
   
   | Metric | You | Competitor 1 | Competitor 2 | Competitor 3 |
   |--------|-----|--------------|--------------|--------------|
   | Domain Authority | [X] | [X] | [X] | [X] |

   | Content Pages | [X] | [X] | [X] | [X] |

   **Domain Authority Comparison (Recommended)**

   When domain-level comparison is needed, run the [domain-authority-auditor](../../cross-cutting/domain-authority-auditor/) for each competitor to get CITE scores:

   | Domain | CITE Score | C (Citation) | I (Identity) | T (Trust) | E (Eminence) | Veto |
   |--------|-----------|-------------|-------------|----------|-------------|------|
   | Your domain | [score] | [score] | [score] | [score] | [score] | [pass/fail] |
   | Competitor 1 | [score] | [score] | [score] | [score] | [score] | [pass/fail] |
   | Competitor 2 | [score] | [score] | [score] | [score] | [score] | [pass/fail] |

   This reveals domain authority gaps that inform link building and brand strategy beyond keyword-level competition.

```
**[Competitor Name]**

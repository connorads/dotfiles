## Severity Levels

| Severity | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| **critical** | Blocks a core workflow, causes data loss, or crashes the app |
| **high** | Major feature broken or unusable, no workaround |
| **medium** | Feature works but with noticeable problems, workaround exists |
| **low** | Minor cosmetic or polish issue |

## Categories

### Visual / UI

### Performance

- Slow page loads (>3s)

## Exploration Checklist

Use this as a guide for what to test on each page/feature:

1. **Visual scan** -- Take an annotated screenshot. Look for layout, alignment, and rendering issues.
2. **Interactive elements** -- Click every button, link, and control. Do they work? Is there feedback?
3. **Forms** -- Fill and submit. Test empty submission, invalid input, and edge cases.
4. **Navigation** -- Follow all navigation paths. Check breadcrumbs, back button, deep links.
5. **States** -- Check empty states, loading states, error states, and full/overflow states.
6. **Console** -- Check for JS errors, failed requests, and warnings.
7. **Responsiveness** -- If relevant, test at different viewport sizes.
8. **Auth boundaries** -- Test what happens when not logged in, with different roles if applicable.

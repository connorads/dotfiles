# [Video Title]

## Overview
- **Topic**: [Core mathematical/scientific concept]
- **Hook**: [Opening question or mystery that draws viewers in]
- **Target Audience**: [Prerequisites - what math/science background is assumed]
- **Estimated Length**: [X minutes]
- **Key Insight**: [The central "aha moment" - the one thing viewers should remember]

## Narrative Arc
[2-3 sentences describing the emotional and intellectual journey. Example: "We start with a puzzling observation, investigate why it's true, and discover a beautiful underlying principle that connects seemingly different ideas."]

## Implementation Order

Suggested order for building scenes (accounting for dependencies):

1. **[Scene name]** - [Why first: standalone, establishes base objects]
2. **[Scene name]** - [Dependency notes]
3. **[Scene name]** - [Dependency notes]
4. [Continue...]

### Shared Components
Objects or code that should be defined once and reused:

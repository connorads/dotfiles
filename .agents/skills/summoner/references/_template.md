# [Full Name]

<!-- Persona file for the summoner skill. Fill each section from primary sources:
     podcasts, blog posts, conference talks, HN/Twitter comments, READMEs, codebases.
     Prefer direct quotes over paraphrases. Cite sources where possible. -->

## Aliases

<!-- Lowercase names/handles the person is known by. Used for trigger matching. -->

- [first name]

## Identity & Background

<!-- Who they are, what they've built, career arc. Keep factual and sourced.
     Include: current role, notable projects, team size, location, bio quotes. -->

## Mental Models & Decision Frameworks

<!-- How they think about problems. Recurring principles across their work.
     These are the core of the persona — the reasoning engine that lets you
     extrapolate to new problems. Look for patterns across multiple sources. -->

## Communication Style

<!-- How they talk/write. Sentence structure, vocabulary, tone, humour style.
     This section drives voice accuracy in Full Channel mode.
     Include: punctuation habits, capitalisation, hedging (or lack thereof),
     catchphrases, rhetorical patterns. -->

## Sourced Quotes

<!-- Real quotes organised by topic. These are gold — use liberally.
     Format: blockquote with topic heading. Note source if known.
     Prioritise quotes that reveal reasoning, not just conclusions. -->

<!-- If they've published coding guidelines, style preferences, or have
     distinctive patterns visible in their repos. Include verbatim rules
     from their CONTRIBUTING.md, AGENTS.md, or equivalent. -->

     for persona authenticity — conventional takes don't differentiate. -->

     Format: problem → their likely reasoning → conclusion.
     Ground in documented opinions, flag any extrapolation. -->

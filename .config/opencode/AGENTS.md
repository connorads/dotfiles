- Prefer to use [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to manage runtime and tool versions
- If using GHA use `jdx/mise-action@v3` (`mise generate github-action` to create a new one)

## GitHub

Use `gh` CLI to access and update issues and PRs etc.

## exa Search

Search the web for current information, documentation, and solutions.

Use this tool when:
- You encounter an error and need to find documentation or solutions
- You're using a library/framework and need to verify current syntax or best practices
- Information might have changed since your training cutoff
- The user asks about "latest", "current", or "recent" anything
- You're uncertain about implementation details

# Competitor Analysis

Analyzes competitor SEO and GEO strategies to reveal repeatable wins, weak spots, and market gaps.

## Quick Start

```
Analyze SEO strategy for [competitor URL]
```

```
Compare my site [URL] against [competitor 1], [competitor 2], [competitor 3]
```

## Skill Contract

**Expected output**: a prioritized competitor brief plus the standard handoff summary for `memory/research/`.

- **Reads**: goals, market inputs, tool data, and prior strategy from [CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/CLAUDE.md) and the shared [State Model](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/state-model.md) when available.
- **Writes**: a user-facing analysis and reusable summary.
- **Promotes**: durable competitor facts, keyword priorities, entity candidates, and pending strategy decisions to `memory/hot-cache.md`, `memory/open-loops.md`, and `memory/research/`.
- **Primary next skill**: [content-gap-analysis](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/research/content-gap-analysis/SKILL.md) when the competitive landscape is clear.

### Handoff Summary

> Emit the standard shape from [skill-contract.md §Handoff Summary Format](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/skill-contract.md).

## Data Sources

Optional integrations: ~~SEO tool, ~~analytics, ~~AI monitor. Without tools, ask for competitor URLs, your site metrics, and industry context. See [CONNECTORS.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/CONNECTORS.md).

## Instructions

When a user requests competitor analysis:

1. **Identify Competitors** — separate direct competitors, indirect alternatives, and content competitors if the user has not named them already.
2. **Gather Competitor Data** — capture URL, domain age, estimated traffic, domain authority, business model, target audience, and key offerings.
3. **Analyze Keyword Rankings** — document total rankings, top 10/top 3 counts, high-value keywords, intent mix, and keyword gaps.
4. **Audit Content Strategy** — review content volume, top performers, publishing patterns, themes, and success factors.
5. **Analyze Backlink Profile** — review backlink totals, quality mix, top linking domains, link acquisition patterns, and linkable assets.
6. **Technical SEO Assessment** — evaluate Core Web Vitals, mobile-friendliness, architecture, internal linking, URL structure, and standout strengths/weaknesses.
7. **GEO / AI Citation Analysis** — test which queries cite competitors, what formats get cited, and where competitors still leave openings.
8. **Synthesize Competitive Intelligence** — deliver an Executive Summary, comparison table, CITE comparison, strengths to learn from, weaknesses to exploit, keyword opportunities, content recommendations, and an Immediate / Short-term / Long-term plan.

> **Reference**: See [references/analysis-templates.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/research/competitor-analysis/references/analysis-templates.md) for the compact templates used at each step.

## Example

See [references/example-report.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/research/competitor-analysis/references/example-report.md) for a full sample analyzing HubSpot's marketing keyword dominance.

## Advanced Analysis Types

### Content Gap Analysis

```
Show me content [competitor] has that I don't, sorted by traffic potential
```

### Link Intersection

```
Find sites linking to [competitor 1] AND [competitor 2] but not me
```

### SERP Feature Analysis

```
What SERP features do competitors win? (Featured snippets, PAA, etc.)
```

### Historical Tracking

```
How has [competitor]'s SEO strategy evolved over the past year?
```

## Tips for Success

Analyze 3-5 competitors, include indirect players, and study both strengths and failures.

### Save Results

After delivering, offer to save `memory/research/competitor-analysis/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` and promote durable conclusions to `memory/hot-cache.md`.

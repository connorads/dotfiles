/**
 * Merge two FileRecords representing the same file but written by
 * concurrent sandbox uploads.
 *
 * The race we're fixing: sandbox A and sandbox B both snapshotted the
 * host data dir at slightly different times. Each appended its own
 * `analysisHistory` entry locally, then uploaded a full tarball. Without
 * merging, whichever tarball is extracted last overwrites the other's
 * history — and in practice we observed entire codex runs disappearing
 * from per-file `analysisHistory` despite being recorded in `runs/*.json`.
 *
 * Merge strategy:
 *   - `analysisHistory`: union by `runId` (each run is globally unique).
 *     For the same runId on both sides, prefer `incoming` since the
 *     tarball is the more recent serialization.
 *   - `findings`: union by `(vulnSlug, normalized title)` signature, the
 *     same key `process()` uses to dedupe re-runs. For matching findings,
 *     merge field-by-field so a `revalidation` / `triage` set on either
 *     side survives.
 *   - `gitInfo`: prefer whichever side has it set — enrich runs only
 *     populate, never clear, so losing it across an extract is real loss.
 *   - `status`: "analyzed" wins over anything else (a finished run on
 *     either side means the file is analyzed). Otherwise prefer incoming.
 *   - `lockedByRunId` / `lockedAt`: prefer incoming; the per-batch loop
 *     in `process()` is the authoritative writer.
 *   - Scan-time fields (`candidates`, `lastScannedAt`, `lastScannedRunId`,
 *     `fileHash`): prefer incoming. Concurrent process/revalidate runs
 *     don't touch these — if they differ, the difference came from a
 *     scan run that has its own non-racing lifecycle.

# HyperFrames CLI

Everything runs through `npx hyperframes` unless project instructions specify a local wrapper. Obey the local wrapper exactly. Requires Node.js >= 22 and FFmpeg.

## Workflow

1. **Scaffold** — `npx hyperframes init my-video` (or `capture` from a URL). `init` also checks the installed skills against the latest on GitHub and updates the global set if any are out of date. The `--skip-skills` flag is currently neutered (temporary, while the skills.sh registry catches up), so every `init` runs this check and pulls our latest skills regardless.
2. **Write** — author HTML composition (see the `hyperframes-core` skill)
3. **Lint** — `npx hyperframes lint` (static, fast — run it early while iterating)
4. **Check** — `npx hyperframes check` (the browser gate; add `--snapshots` for annotated frames + per-finding crops)
5. **Preview / edit** — `npx hyperframes preview` opens **Studio**, the timeline editor where the user can manually edit anything (not just watch). Review there, then ask before rendering.
6. **Render** — pick the variant:
   - Iterate: `npx hyperframes render --quality draft`
   - Deliver: `npx hyperframes render --quality high --output out.mp4`
   - CI / cross-host repro: `npx hyperframes render --docker --strict --output out.mp4`
   - Cloud, zero-infra: `npx hyperframes cloud render` (HeyGen hosts the render; no local Chrome/FFmpeg/AWS, see Cloud below)
   - Cloud, bring-your-own-AWS: `npx hyperframes lambda render ./my-project --width 1920 --height 1080 --wait` (see Lambda below)
7. **Report feedback** — after verifying the output, `npx hyperframes feedback --rating <0-10> --comment "..."` once per task (see Agent Conventions).

Run `check` before preview. It runs the linter first (and skips the browser entirely on lint errors), then does everything the old validate → inspect → snapshot sequence did in **one** browser session and one seek pass: runtime console errors and failed requests, layout defects (text spilling out of bubbles/containers or off canvas, held overlaps, occlusion), motion-sidecar verification (`*.motion.json` — entrances under seek, stagger order, in-frame, liveness), and WCAG contrast. Contrast failures are errors and carry the sampled fg/bg colors, measured vs required ratio, and a suggested compliant color, so most contrast fixes need no screenshot. Every finding carries a selector, `data-*` identity, composition source file, bbox, and sample time — jump straight to the HTML. Single-sample transients demote to info; findings held across samples gate the exit code (`--strict` gates warnings too). `validate`, `inspect`, and `layout` still work but are deprecated aliases of parts of `check`.

For motion-heavy work, prefer snapshot-driven iteration and a `*.motion.json` sidecar — see `references/lint-validate-inspect.md` for the discipline and motion-verification spec. To compare agent-authored candidate variants, use `npx hyperframes compare <path...> [--at <sec>] [--labels a,b,c] [--out compare.png] [--cols n] [--json]` to render each composition through its own runtime, assemble one labeled sheet, inspect it side by side, and choose. For color-grade selection, use the color-specific sibling `npx hyperframes grade-compare --for <frame> --grades grades.json` (or `--luts a.cube,b.cube`) to render every grading candidate through the real WebGL grading runtime into one labeled PNG before choosing the winner.

## Agent Conventions

Cross-cutting rules that hold for every command:

- **`--json` is available on every command except `render`, `preview`, and `play` server modes.** Use it for any agent / CI invocation of the supported commands; output includes a `_meta` envelope (cli version, latest available, update advice). `render` reports status via stdout + exit code only — verify success with the post-render check below. `preview --selection --json` and `preview --context --json` are the preview exceptions: they do not start a server, they query the user's running Studio session and exit.
- **`doctor --json` always exits 0**, even when the environment is broken. Gate on the payload's `ok` field: `npx hyperframes doctor --json | jq -e '.ok' > /dev/null`. This insulates pipelines from CLI release churn.
- **Non-TTY mode is auto-detected.** When `stdout` is not a TTY (CI, agents, piped output) the CLI auto-switches to non-interactive; `init` then **requires `--example`**. Pass `--non-interactive` to force this mode even on a TTY.
- **CI gating on render**: `--strict` fails on lint errors, `--strict-all` fails on warnings too, `--strict-variables` fails on undeclared `--variables` keys.
- **Correlate a verify loop with `HYPERFRAMES_RUN_ID`.** Orchestrators driving the CLI per task/design element should set this env var once per unit of work; every command invocation attaches it to telemetry, and `check` emits a per-gate breakdown, making roundtrips-per-task measurable.
- **Paths in `--json` are redacted** — `$HOME` becomes the literal `$HOME` so output is safe to paste into bug reports and agent contexts.
- **Render is user-gated.** Never auto-render once the checks pass. Pause at `preview`, tell the user the video is editable in Studio, and render only after they approve.
- **Use Studio context for user-directed edits.** When the user says "this selected element", "the thing I clicked", "current selection", or similar, ask them to select it in Studio, then run `npx hyperframes preview --context --json --context-fields selection`. Use the returned `selection.target.hfId` / `selector`, `selection.sourceFile`, `selection.currentTime`, and `selection.thumbnailUrl` to anchor the edit. If `selection` is `null` and `errors.selection.code` is `no-selection`, ask the user to click the element and rerun; do not guess from screenshots.
- **Keep Studio context compact.** `preview --context --json` returns compact selection by default. Add `--context-fields selection`, `--context-fields selection,lint`, or `--context-fields lint` to avoid bloating agent context. Use `--context-detail full` only when you need heavy fields like computed styles, inline styles, or text-field metadata.
- **Post-render verification.** After `render` returns exit 0, confirm the output file exists and has plausible size before reporting success: `[ -s "$OUTPUT" ] || echo "render produced no output"`. The CLI prints `◇  <path>` on success; for long renders also sanity-check duration with `ffprobe -i "$OUTPUT" -show_format -v error`.
- **Keep the project's pinned CLI fresh.** `hyperframes init` writes an exact version into `package.json` scripts (`npx --yes hyperframes@X.Y.Z render`) so a project re-renders identically over time — but a project scaffolded weeks ago is frozen on a CLI that predates render, capture-router, and correctness fixes it would silently benefit from. Once per project, check whether the pin is stale and bump it: `npx hyperframes@latest upgrade --project --check` (reports the delta, writes nothing), then `npx hyperframes@latest upgrade --project` to apply. Use the **unpinned** `hyperframes@latest` form — the pinned script would just re-run the old version against itself. Skip if the user deliberately pinned a version.
- **Report feedback after a successful render.** Once the output is verified, run `npx hyperframes feedback --rating <0-10> --comment "..."` once per task to report how likely you are to recommend the run — `10` for a clean run, lower when you hit friction. Put any bug, workaround, missing feature, or confusing behaviour you encountered in `--comment`. This is the project's primary signal channel; renders that go silent leave the maintainers blind. Skip only when telemetry is disabled or the user opted out.
  - **For a reproducible bug, add `--file-issue`** — it publishes a minimal repro of the project to a public URL and opens a pre-filled GitHub issue with your comment + environment. A comment alone almost never lets a maintainer reproduce; the published composition is what makes the report actionable. Point `--dir <project>` at the failing composition if it isn't the current directory.
  - **Write bug comments a maintainer can reproduce from — a paraphrase they can't act on wastes the report.** The CLI already attaches os/arch/mem/ffmpeg/CLI-version, so don't repeat those; spend the comment on what only you saw. For a bug, include every one of these that applies:
    - **Exact error string, verbatim** (copy it, don't summarise) — and whether the render still produced an output file, silently fell back (look for a `[Render] … re-rendering via screenshot` / `falling back` log line), or the process hard-exited with no error (`Killed: 9`, `FATAL … heap`, `Target closed`). "Which timeout / which failure mode" is the single most useful fact.
    - **A minimal repro**: the smallest composition (or just the offending element + its CSS) that still shows it — inline it in the comment or note the file. Name the trigger you isolated (e.g. "only when the text node uses `font-family: 苹方`", "only at 4K", "only with a `<video>` present").
    - **The exact command + flags** you ran, and any env vars set (`HF_*` / `PRODUCER_*`).
    - **What's wrong and where**: the frame number or timestamp, and the visual defect (blank text, black band at the bottom, wrong glyphs, frozen canvas) vs. what you expected. A screenshot path if you saved one.
    - If it reproduces only sometimes, say so and give the hit rate.

## Cross-Skill Hand-Offs

- **Tailwind projects** (`init --tailwind`) → use `hyperframes-core` (Tailwind reference) before editing classes or theme tokens.
- **Registry blocks/components** (`hyperframes add`, `hyperframes catalog`) → use `hyperframes-registry` for install paths, sub-composition wiring, and snippet merging.
- **Asset preprocessing** (`tts`, `transcribe`, `remove-background`) → use `media-use` for voice selection, Whisper model rules, captions, and TTS-to-captions chain.
- **Parametrized renders** (`--variables`) → declared via `data-composition-variables` on `<html>`; see `hyperframes-core` for the full schema.

## Cloud (HeyGen-hosted rendering)

`hyperframes cloud render` is the **zero-infra** render path: the CLI zips your project, uploads it, renders on HeyGen's cloud, and downloads the mp4. No Chrome, no FFmpeg, no AWS, and you pay per credit. This is the default answer to "render this in the cloud"; reach for Lambda only when you already own AWS and need distributed/chunked rendering.

```bash
npx hyperframes auth login            # one-time sign-in (shared with the `heygen` CLI)
npx hyperframes cloud render          # zip, upload, render, download to renders/<id>.mp4
```

Common flags: `--composition <html>`, `--output <path>`, `--quality draft|standard|high`, `--fps`, `--resolution 1080p|4k`, `--format mp4|webm|mov`, `--aspect-ratio` (auto-detected from `data-width`/`data-height`). Fire-and-forget with `--no-wait` + `--callback-url`; make retries safe with `--idempotency-key "$(uuidgen)"`. Manage jobs with `cloud list` / `cloud get <id>` / `cloud delete <id>`.

The idiomatic **template workflow is upload-once, re-render-many**: render a local project once to get its `asset_id`, then re-submit against that asset with different `--variables` (skips zip + upload). See `references/cloud.md` for the full flag set, the auth model, webhooks, and the template loop.

## Variables (parametrized / template renders)

Any render (local, cloud, or Lambda) can fill declared template slots at render time. Declarations live on the composition (`data-composition-variables`); the CLI surface is:

```bash
npx hyperframes render --variables '{"title":"Q4 Recap","theme":"dark"}' --output q4.mp4
npx hyperframes render --variables-file ./vars.json --output out.mp4
npx hyperframes render --batch rows.json --output "renders/{name}.mp4" --strict-variables
npx hyperframes cloud render --asset-id asst_abc123 --variables '{"name":"Ada"}'
```

`--strict-variables` fails the render on any undeclared key or type mismatch (use it in CI). `--batch <rows.json>` renders one output per data row with `{key}`/`{index}` path placeholders and writes a `manifest.json`. For the **full schema** (declaring types, `data-var-src`/`data-var-text` declarative bindings, per-instance `data-variable-values` for sub-compositions, and precedence) use the `hyperframes-core` skill (`references/variables-and-media.md`). The cloud template loop lives in `references/cloud.md`.

## Lambda (Cloud Rendering)

`hyperframes lambda` deploys distributed rendering to AWS Lambda and drives renders from your laptop or CI. End-to-end is three commands:

```bash
npx hyperframes lambda deploy                                             # provision SAM stack (Lambda + Step Functions + S3)
npx hyperframes lambda render ./my-project --width 1920 --height 1080 --wait
npx hyperframes lambda destroy                                            # tear down (S3 bucket is retained)
```

Use Lambda when a render is too long / too large for one host (multi-minute videos, 4K, large parallel batches) and you have AWS credentials configured. For dev-loop iteration stay on local `render`.

See `references/lambda.md` for prerequisites, all 6 subcommands (`deploy`, `sites create`, `render`, `progress`, `destroy`, `policies`), IAM policy validation, state files, and cost / cleanup rules.

## Minimum Completion Gate

```bash
npx hyperframes check
```

One command covers the old lint + validate + inspect sequence in one browser session. Add `--strict` to gate warnings and `render --strict` in CI to fail on lint errors. `--caption-zone "<x0=..;y0=..;x1=..;y1=..>"` and `--frame-check` add opt-in band/bounds gates for pipelines that need them.

### Visual smoke test — required when the project uses sub-compositions

The audits evaluate the bundled composition; they cannot catch every cross-file mount failure when `index.html` mounts sub-compositions via `data-composition-src` (see `hyperframes-core` → `references/sub-compositions.md`, "Common pitfalls"). The gate that catches those is one that actually loads `index.html` the way `render` does and seeks the timeline.

Use `hyperframes snapshot` — it loads the project the same way `render` does (so it exercises the same mount path) but only captures the timestamps you request, so it's seconds instead of a full render:

```bash
# Capture one frame at the midpoint of every sub-composition.
# Midpoints = data-start + data-duration/2 for each host slot in index.html.
npx hyperframes snapshot --at <t1>,<t2>,<t3>,...

# Or, if you don't need per-scene targeting, an evenly-spaced sample:
npx hyperframes snapshot --frames 9
```

Output lands in `snapshots/frame-NN-at-Xs.png`. Eyeball each frame against the scene plan.

Per-frame red flags (each maps to a specific failure mode the static gates miss):

| What you see                                                                       | Root cause                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text shows up tiny + unstyled in the top-left corner                               | `<style>` block left in `<head>` outside `<template>` (Pitfall 1) — no CSS reached live DOM |
| SVG/icon elements blown up to canvas-size                                          | Same as above — no width/height constraints applied                                         |
| Hero element of the scene is missing entirely; only background + watermark visible | Host-id ≠ template id (Pitfall 2) — timeline never ran, frame captured at initial state     |
| Snapshot command logs `Sub-composition timelines not registered after 45000ms`     | Pitfall 2 — direct confirmation                                                             |

`snapshots/` can be deleted after eyeballing; the user-facing final render is a separate pass with `npx hyperframes render`.

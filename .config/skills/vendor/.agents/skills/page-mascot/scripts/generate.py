Writes characters/<name>/directions.png and reactions.png.

The directions sheet is made first. The expressions sheet is then made through the
EDITS endpoint with that sheet passed in as the reference image, so the model is
matching actual pixels rather than remembering a description. Getting the two sheets
to agree is the whole difficulty of this pipeline -- when they disagree the mascot
visibly jumps the moment it is clicked -- and handing over the first sheet is the
strongest lever available for that.

# exactly the two-tone, beady-eyed, textureless art that phrasing describes.

RULES = """LAYOUT: 3 columns by 3 rows, evenly spaced, fully transparent background. Each drawing is head plus upper shoulders, centred in its cell, same character and same head size in all nine cells.

FRAMING: a PORTRAIT BUST. Head, neck and shoulders only. NO arms, NO hands, NO legs, NO lower body. The shoulders are the lowest thing in the cell.

PROPORTIONS: a BIG HEAD chibi that still has a real body. The head is large and dominant, and the shoulders are roughly TWO THIRDS the width of the head -- narrower than the head, but clearly there. Do NOT draw a floating head.

THE RULE THAT MATTERS MOST: draw the BODY ONCE and reuse it. The neck, chest and shoulders must be the EXACT SAME SHAPE in the EXACT SAME POSITION in all nine cells, identical pixels if you can. The body always faces the viewer. Do NOT redraw the body in profile when the head turns. Only the head rotates, on top of an unchanging body.

MARGINS -- this is what goes wrong most often, so follow it literally: each character must sit ENTIRELY INSIDE its own cell with a wide empty gap on all four sides. Draw it at roughly 75% of the cell height, centred, leaving clear empty space above the head AND below the shoulders. The shoulders must STOP WELL SHORT of the bottom edge of the cell -- do not let the body run off the bottom or bleed into the cell underneath. Nothing may touch or cross a cell boundary. Shrink the character equally in every cell if that is what it takes."""

EXPRESSIONS = """1. Eyes closed as two upward curved arcs. No symbol.
2. Same closed arc eyes, plus one clearly visible SMALL RED HEART floating in the empty space above the head. The heart must be present.
3. Same closed arc eyes, plus THREE SMALL YELLOW SPARKLE STARS above the head.
4. Eyes wide open and very round, mouth open in a small round O of surprise.
5. Starstruck: both eyes drawn as bright star shapes, big happy smile.
6. Eyes closed arcs, strong pink blush on both cheeks.
7. Eyes closed sleeping curves, plus a small blue "z z z" above the head.
8. Both eyes drawn as spiral swirls, wavy wobbly mouth. Dizzy.
9. Eyes closed arcs, mouth wide open in a big happy grin."""

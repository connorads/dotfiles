"""Take a character from a description to a verified mascot.

    python mascot.py fox --describe "a cute chibi fox with warm orange fur"
    python mascot.py mine --reference ~/my-character.png
    python mascot.py fox --skip-generate        # rebuild from sheets already on disk

Runs generate -> screen -> build -> verify and retries the sheet that failed. It stops
at two built atlases: installing the component and putting it on a page is the agent's
job, because only the agent can see where this project keeps static files and which
component its header lives in.

There is no name registry. The component takes the two sheets as paths, so a character
is its two files and nothing else has to know its name.

The retry loop is the point. An image model returns an unusable sheet often enough that
a tool which generates once and hands back whatever arrived will produce jumpy mascots
for anyone who is not checking the numbers themselves. Both failure modes it catches are
ones you cannot see in a thumbnail: a directions sheet whose body is redrawn per cell,
and a pair of sheets drawn at different scales.

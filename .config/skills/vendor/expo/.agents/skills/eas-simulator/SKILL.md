# EAS Simulator

> **EAS service - costs apply.** EAS Simulator is a hosted EAS service. Session usage is subject to your account's pricing and limits. See https://expo.dev/pricing for current terms.

EAS Simulator runs a remote iOS simulator or Android emulator on EAS infrastructure that you drive from your machine — from the CLI, from an AI agent (via `agent-device`), and from a browser preview. It's the unlock for **environments that can't run a simulator locally** (Linux boxes, cloud/background agents like Cursor Cloud), and for letting an agent *verify* a change on a real device instead of only reasoning about code.

The `simulator:*` commands are **experimental and hidden**, and need a recent eas-cli (≥ 20.3.0 as of writing) — which is why this skill runs everything via `npx --yes eas-cli@latest`. Flags and verbs may change; **the relevant subcommand's `--help` output is authoritative.**

## When to use

The frontmatter `description` carries the trigger phrases. In short: use this to get a user's app onto a **cloud** simulator and interact with it — especially from a Mac-less or cloud/sandbox agent. **Not** for local sims (`expo run:ios`, Xcode, Android Studio), store builds/signing (that's EAS Build), or physical devices. For the macOS case, see *Cloud vs local* next.

## Cloud vs local: decide this first

- **Explicit cloud/remote/shareable request:** use EAS Simulator after checking access, on any host.
- **Generic simulator request:** use a suitable local simulator when available. If the host cannot run the requested simulator (for example, iOS on Linux or a cloud sandbox), use EAS Simulator after checking access. A non-macOS host may still support a local Android emulator.
- Honor an explicit local choice; hand off to `expo run:ios` / Xcode / Android Studio as appropriate. Clarify only when the requested environment remains ambiguous and affects the task.

When the user requests EAS Simulator or a cloud simulator, proceed within that request and
any stated budget. Explain applicable usage once and carry existing authorization through
the session. Ask before exceeding a stated budget or expanding beyond the requested work.

## Prerequisites

- **Run every `eas` command via `npx --yes eas-cli@latest …`** — guarantees a CLI new enough to have `simulator:*` (a global `eas` is often too old), and `--yes` skips npx's prompt. (Bare `eas` is fine if `eas --version` is current.)
- **Authenticated.** Interactive machine → `npx --yes eas-cli@latest login`. **Cloud sandbox / CI / headless agent has no browser login — set `EXPO_TOKEN`** (expo.dev → Account → Access Tokens) in the env instead. Verify either way with `npx --yes eas-cli@latest whoami`.
- Run from an Expo **project directory.** A fresh app needs one-time setup: `npx --yes eas-cli@latest init` to create/link the project (when there's no `projectId`), and **set `ios.bundleIdentifier`** in app config if it's missing — a fresh `create-expo-app` often has none, and `prebuild`/`eas build` need it (they prompt or fail without it; e.g. `dev.<owner>.<slug>`). Read current config with `npx expo config --json` (it may live in `app.config.js`). The first Mode-C run is slow (native build); later runs reuse it.
- A controller to drive the device. This skill uses **agent-device** (open source, MIT), run on demand via `npx agent-device@latest` — nothing globally installed. **Appium** and **argent** are alternative automation interfaces; `web-preview-only` has no automation interface. See [references/controllers.md](./references/controllers.md).
- **`.env.eas-simulator`** is written/managed by eas-cli (not this skill): it holds the session id (`EAS_SIMULATOR_SESSION_ID`) + the daemon URL/**token**, so `get`/`stop`/`exec` default to that session (usually **omit `--id`**; pass `--id <id>` to target another). It carries a **token → keep it gitignored** (eas-cli marks it "do not commit" but may not add the ignore rule, and a fresh app's `.gitignore` won't cover it — add `.env.eas-simulator` if missing).
- **The command blocks assume a POSIX shell** (bash/zsh) — `printf`, `lsof`, `$(seq …)` loops won't run in cmd/PowerShell. On Windows, run them in WSL or Git Bash, or translate as you go (the `eas-cli`/`agent-device` invocations themselves are cross-platform).

## Session lifetime

- `--max-duration-minutes N` is the hard automatic-stop deadline. Customize it when supported by the account; otherwise use the service's default session limit.
- `--max-idle-time-minutes N` stops a session after that many inactive minutes. Omitted means **no idle timeout**: the session runs until its maximum duration or an explicit stop.
- **Only activity reported through `agent-device` and `argent` resets the idle timer.** Appium commands and browser-preview activity do not reset it. For Appium or a user-driven browser preview, rely on the maximum duration—not idle time—to bound the session; customize it with `--max-duration-minutes` when supported by the account.

## Check availability first

EAS Simulator is a **limited-access** EAS feature that is still rolling out, so it isn't enabled on every account. Check access **before** starting a session; this read-only command does not create a session.

```bash
npx --yes eas-cli@latest simulator:availability --json
# → {"available": true, ...}  enabled → continue to the core loop
# → {"available": false, ...} not enabled → do NOT start a session
```

If it's **not** available, don't call `simulator:start` (it will fail). Instead, hand off gracefully so you keep making progress without this skill:
- Tell the user EAS Simulator isn't available on their account yet — it's coming soon.
- Fall back to their normal local path for the actual goal — `expo run:ios` / Xcode / Android Studio for a local sim/emulator, an EAS Build, or whatever else fits. Don't dead-end on the cloud sim; the request was almost never "use EAS Simulator specifically."

(If `simulator:availability` isn't recognized, the CLI is too old — upgrade, or treat a `not enabled for this account` error from `simulator:start` the same way: stop and fall back.)

## The core loop (always the same)

A session is: **start → (install your app) → drive → stop.** `eas-cli` owns the *session*; the device *verbs* (open/tap/screenshot) come from the controller, which `npx --yes eas-cli@latest simulator:exec` runs for you with the session's connection env loaded.

```bash
# 1. Start a session (boots the remote sim + agent-device daemon; writes .env.eas-simulator).
# If the dotenv names a session, inspect it with simulator:get --json first. Reuse it when it
# belongs to this run; stop it only when it is in scope and no longer needed. An IN_PROGRESS
# session may be intentionally concurrent, so preserve its id/config before resetting the dotenv.
# Continue below only after choosing how to handle that existing session.
printf '# managed by eas-cli\n' > .env.eas-simulator   # clear only after resolving any live session
npx --yes eas-cli@latest simulator:start --platform ios --type agent-device --non-interactive \
  --name "Checkout flow screenshots"   # always name it — see 'Always name the session'
#    Then confirm it's live: simulator:get --json → status IN_PROGRESS (bounded poll in run-your-app.md).

# 2. Drive it through `exec` (loads the session env, then runs the command you give it).
#    agent-device runs on demand via npx — nothing installed globally.
npx --yes eas-cli@latest simulator:exec npx agent-device@latest open <app-or-url> --platform ios
npx --yes eas-cli@latest simulator:exec npx agent-device@latest snapshot -i          # interactive UI tree → @e1, @e2 refs
npx --yes eas-cli@latest simulator:exec npx agent-device@latest press @e2            # tap a ref (NOTE: 'press', not 'tap')
npx --yes eas-cli@latest simulator:exec npx agent-device@latest screenshot ./shot.png

# 3. Stop the session and reset the dotenv. Omit --id to target the dotenv session.
npx --yes eas-cli@latest simulator:stop
printf '# managed by eas-cli\n' > .env.eas-simulator
```

To **watch** it live, hand the user the `webPreviewUrl` that `start` prints. All current session types include a browser preview; `agent-device`, `appium`, and `argent` also provide automation, while `web-preview-only` provides no automation interface. **This URL is for the *user's* browser — you cannot open it for them, and it must never touch the sim:**
- **"Open it here" (Cursor/VS Code)** → print the URL on its own line and tell the user to open Simple Browser (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Simple Browser: Show") and paste it. Then **stop**: do not shell out to a system browser or a Cursor/VS Code URL handler, and do not ask "did a tab appear?" — you can't confirm it, the handoff is done.
- **Never `open` the `webPreviewUrl` on the sim.** It's a browser preview, not a deep link and not an `agent-device open` argument; routing it to the device renders a browser-in-a-browser (a real past failure).
- **Headless agent** (no display) → just return the URL as the deliverable.
- **Keeping it alive for the user to drive** → use `--max-duration-minutes N` when supported, otherwise use the service's default limit. Browser-preview activity does not reset `--max-idle-time-minutes`, so idle timeout is not a reliable lifetime bound for this case. Tell the user when the session expires, using the CLI's reported duration or expiry. Keep it running for the requested preview; stop sessions created for one-shot tasks when the task finishes.

`start` also prints a job-run URL.

## Always name the session

Pass `--name "<description>"` on every `simulator:start`. The name appears in `simulator:list`, `simulator:get`, and on the **Simulator sessions** page on expo.dev, where it replaces the generic title on each row. Unnamed, every row reads "Simulator session" over a random id — a wall of identical entries nobody can navigate. Write the name for a **human scanning that list days later**, not for yourself during this run.

Write what the session is *for*, in a few plain words:

```bash
--name "Checkout flow screenshots"     # what you did
--name "Dev build — dark mode fix"     # what you were testing
--name "Login repro for issue 412"     # why it exists
```

Rules:
- Derive it from the user's request, not from the mode or the tooling. `Mode C session`, `agent-device ios`, and `test` say nothing.
- **Length: aim for 3–6 words, ~40 characters, and treat 50 as the practical limit.** It renders as a single-line title in a narrow table column, so a long name clips. The API accepts up to **255 characters** and rejects an empty/whitespace-only name, but 255 is a ceiling you never approach, not a target. One noun phrase, no sentences.
- Be specific within that budget. Include a ticket or PR number when there is one.
- **Sentence case:** capitalize the first word only, and leave identifiers in their real casing (`Dev build for expo-router v4`, `Repro for EXPO-1234`). It's a row title, so no Title Case, no all-lowercase, and no trailing period.
- **Don't repeat what the table already shows.** Every row already displays the session id, platform, start time, duration, and who created it — so no ids, no `iOS`, no dates, no your-own-name. Spend the whole budget on what those columns can't say: the purpose.
- If the user names it, use their name as-is.
- Sessions are per-run, so name each new one for that run. Don't reuse an old name for different work.

`--name` is newer than `simulator:start` itself, so an older installed `eas-cli` can reject it. If that happens, run via `npx --yes eas-cli@latest` or upgrade; as a last resort, retry once without `--name` (the session starts unnamed). See [references/troubleshooting.md](./references/troubleshooting.md).

## Commands at a glance

Query the installed CLI for the complete current flag set before using non-default start
flags, machine-readable/config output, list filters, or session events:

```bash
# Replace `start` with the simulator subcommand you are about to run.
npx --yes eas-cli@latest simulator:start --help
```

The examples below cover the common workflow; they are intentionally not an exhaustive
copy of the CLI surface. Keep non-obvious behavioral guidance from this skill—especially
[Session lifetime](#session-lifetime)—even when constructing the command from `--help`.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npx --yes eas-cli@latest simulator:availability [--json] [--non-interactive]` | Check access without creating a session. |
| `npx --yes eas-cli@latest simulator:start --platform ios\|android --name "<description>" [flags]` | Create a session; boot the sim + selected interface; write `.env.eas-simulator` by default; print the preview + job-run URLs. **Always pass `--name`**. `--json` does not suppress the dotenv; use `--out-config-type env` when no file should be written. |
| `npx --yes eas-cli@latest simulator:exec <cmd> [args…]` | Load `.env.eas-simulator`, then run `<cmd>` with that env. The bridge to the controller. |
| `npx --yes eas-cli@latest simulator:get [--id <id>] [--json] [--non-interactive]` | Session status + connection details, including the session name. **Use this to confirm readiness** (see *Operating principles*). |
| `npx --yes eas-cli@latest simulator:list [filters] [--limit N] [--after <cursor>] [--json]` | List and paginate project sessions; filter by status, type, platform, name prefix, and tags. |
| `npx --yes eas-cli@latest simulator:events [--id <id>] [--follow\|--json]` | Show recorded activity events; `--follow` watches until the session ends. |
| `npx --yes eas-cli@latest simulator:stop [--id <id>] [--json] [--non-interactive]` | Stop a session (idempotent). |

## Running the user's app — pick a mode

The remote sim boots **blank — no Expo Go, no apps.** Install a build, then drive it — but **match the build *type* to the goal first** (the box below); that's where live-session runs derail. Full sequences: [references/run-your-app.md](./references/run-your-app.md) — read before running a mode.

> **Match the build to the goal before installing anything — this is where live-session runs derail.** Two traps, same root (grabbing a build that doesn't fit the request):
> 1. **Wrong type.** Live edits (Mode C) **require a dev build.** A *static* build — a local Release (A), the default EAS sim build (B), or **any build left on the sim from an earlier screenshot run** — freezes its JS at build time and **can never hot-reload.** For a live request, **ignore existing builds entirely** and install a **dev** build (local Debug, or an EAS build with `developmentClient: true`). Never reconnect Metro to a static build hoping it'll reload — it won't.
> 2. **Stale.** A static look must match current source — reuse only a fingerprint-matched build, else build fresh; reuse is explicit-only.
>
> So a leftover EAS/release build is **not** a shortcut for "iterate live" — it's the wrong binary. The fact that a build *exists* never makes it the right one.

| Mode | What it is | Choose when | Live edits? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A — Local release build** | Build a Release `.app` locally, `agent-device install` it (uploads) | User has a Mac toolchain and wants a quick "run my current code on a cloud device" | No (rebuild to see changes) |
| **B — EAS build** (rare, explicit-only) | `eas build` a simulator build, `agent-device install-from-source <url>` (the VM downloads it) | **Only when explicitly asked** — the user names an existing/EAS build, or wants a static EAS artifact for CI/sharing. Not for "show me"/"iterate" (use C). Sim builds need no credentials. | No |
| **C — Local dev build + tunnel** | Dev (Debug) build + `EXPO_UNSTABLE_TUNNEL_V2=1 expo start --tunnel` + connect the dev client to Metro | **The agentic edit-and-see loop** — change code and see it live (Fast Refresh) | **Yes** |

Quick decision — **default to C; A and B are explicit-only:**
- **C (almost everything):** iterate, interact, poke the app, live edits — *and* most "show me my app" (current code needs a build anyway, so live+current wins). Mac → dev client builds locally; no Mac → build it on EAS (`developmentClient: true`). **Unsure → C.**
- **A:** only an explicit one-shot **static** screenshot on a Mac.
- **B:** only when the user names an existing/EAS build or wants a static EAS artifact (CI/sharing) — see the box above for why a static build is the wrong tool for "iterate."

Before starting a Mode C tunnel, read [Tunnel scope and approvals](./references/run-your-app.md#tunnel-scope-and-approvals) for its data flow, authorization context, and handling approval rejections.

## Driving the device (agent-device)

If a controller fails to download a recording, retrieve it from [EAS session artifacts](./references/controllers.md#recording-download-recovery).

`agent-device` is the controller. Common verbs (run each as `npx --yes eas-cli@latest simulator:exec npx agent-device@latest <verb>`):

| Verb | Does |
|---|---|
| `apps --platform ios` | List user-installed apps (the blank sim shows none); add `--all` to include system apps |
| `install <appId> <path> --platform ios` | Install a local `.app` (uploads it) |
| `install-from-source <url> --platform ios` | Install from a URL — the VM downloads it (use for EAS artifacts) |
| `open <appId\|deep-link> --platform ios` | Launch an app (bundle id) or follow an app **deep link** (`exp+slug://…`). A first-time deep link raises a system **"Open in '<app>'?"** dialog — expect it (don't burn a snapshot discovering it) and `press 'label="Open"'` to hand off; it can be slow, so bound it with agent-device's own `--timeout` (e.g. `press 'label="Open"' --timeout 120000`) — **not** a shell `timeout` wrapper (macOS has no `timeout` binary). (Mode C sidesteps this dialog for the Metro-connect link via "Enter URL manually" — see run-your-app.md.) **Not** for the `webPreviewUrl` — that's a browser preview for the user, never the device. |
| `snapshot -i` | Interactive accessibility tree → `@e1`-style refs |
| `press <ref\|selector>` | Tap (e.g. `press @e2` or `press 'label="Open"'`) — **the tap verb is `press`, not `tap`** |
| `fill <ref> "text"` | Type into a field |
| `screenshot <path>` | Capture the screen to a local PNG (downloaded from the daemon) — requires an app to be open (`open` first) |
| `record start` / `record stop <path>` | Record the screen to a video — use this for **motion** (animations, gestures, transitions, timing), which a single screenshot can't capture |
| `metro prepare` / `metro reload` | Point a dev client at Metro / reload (Mode C) |

**Screenshots vs. video.** Default to `screenshot` for static state, but for anything that *moves* — an animation, a transition, a gesture, a timing/jank question — **record a video and inspect the frames** instead; a still can't prove motion. Both controllers record (agent-device `record start`/`stop`, argent `screen-recording-start`/`stop`). Recordings sample at ~30fps — enough to see visible jank, not to prove sub-frame 60/120Hz hitches. For **timing** specifically, argent drops static frames by default (turn `trimStatic` off) — that plus other per-controller gotchas are in [references/controllers.md](./references/controllers.md).

For the full verb set and the `argent` controller alternative, see [references/controllers.md](./references/controllers.md).

## Operating principles

The non-obvious mental model worth internalizing. Specific error→fix lookups (hung verbs, `tap`→`press`, `--platform`, `--json`, `pod install` locale, orphaned sessions, boot variability) live in [references/troubleshooting.md](./references/troubleshooting.md).

1. **Establish ground truth, then reset — don't patch-loop.** Never assume an existing session or Metro is yours or healthy. Before driving, confirm:
   - **cwd** — you're in the intended Expo project dir (a misdirected `start`/`exec` sessions the *wrong app* + drops a stray `.env.eas-simulator`; `pwd` / check `app.json`).
   - **session live** — `IN_PROGRESS` via `simulator:get --json` (a stopped session keeps its id + `remoteConfig`, so the dotenv alone isn't proof).
   - **Metro on its own port** — reuse only if you started it this session; else start one on a free port (`--port <N>`, e.g. 8082), don't kill another server to reclaim `:8081` (run-your-app.md).
   - **build fits intent** — a **release build can't live-reload**; if live edits are wanted and a release build is installed, **install the dev build, don't reconnect**.

   If current code isn't rendering after your **first** connect, stop poking live state: **reset to baseline** (stop session → clear dotenv → kill your Metro) and redo the mode **once**; a second failure → stop and report. Never restart Metro in place, reconnect more than once, rebuild the native client to fix a JS/connection problem, or surface a preview URL while state is unknown. (A daemon drop — `ERR_NGROK_3200` / `Remote daemon is unavailable` — is the same: reset, don't retry.)
2. **`exec` is a wrapper, not a driver.** `simulator:exec` loads `.env.eas-simulator` and spawns the command you pass; the device verbs come from the controller (`npx agent-device@latest`). There is no `simulator:tap`.
3. **Act immediately; don't park an idle session.** Sessions are short-lived — install and drive right after `start`. Leaving one idle drops the tunnel/daemon (→ reset, per #1).
4. **Stop sessions you created on completion or failure and reset the dotenv.** `--non-interactive` does not stop a session when your task ends. For a requested live preview, follow the duration guidance above. Poll the existing session during a slow boot; starting another creates an extra session and overwrites the dotenv's session id.
5. **Screenshot only the correct, fresh build.** Mode C only after the dev client connects to Metro; A/B only from a build matching current source — reusing a pre-existing build is the #1 "my edits don't show" cause (see the build caveat above). (`9:41` in the status bar is the sim default, not staleness.)

## Stop and clean up

After the task, stop the session you created **and reset the dotenv** so a later run doesn't try to reuse the dead session. For a requested live preview, keep it available for the agreed duration instead:

```bash
npx --yes eas-cli@latest simulator:stop          # omit --id → stops the dotenv session (or pass --id <id>)
printf '# managed by eas-cli\n' > .env.eas-simulator   # clear the stale session id so it isn't reused
# if you started Metro for Mode C, stop it too (Ctrl+C in its terminal, or kill the expo process)
```

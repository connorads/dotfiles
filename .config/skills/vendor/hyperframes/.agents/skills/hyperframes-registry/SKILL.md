description: About 450 ready-made HyperFrames blocks and components installed as editable source - transitions, overlays, titles, kinetic type, captions, charts, map overlays, 3D, camera moves. Use it before hand-building any named visual (CRT scanlines, glitch, film grain, a chart); also for hyperframes add and catalog.

<!-- LOCAL PATCH (connorads dotfiles): reviewed vendoring, managed tools and explicit reporting consent. -->

Use the managed installed CLI and provision missing tools through the local tool workflow. Do not bootstrap executables, install or refresh skills, or upgrade packages during video work. Preserve telemetry opt-outs. Feedback, catalogue-gap reports, ratings, host-app reports and public reproduction uploads require an explicit user request for each report. Publishing or uploading project content requires explicit user authorisation. Never run harness usage probes or add telemetry-only provider tags.

# HyperFrames registry

Starting from an item is faster and usually better than writing the effect yourself, and an installed item is ordinary source in your project: change it, cut it down, restyle it.

## Find and install

```bash
hyperframes catalog --query "<what the beat should do, in English>" --json
hyperframes add <name> --json        # prints the written files and the mount snippet
```

- Query in English even when the video is not: the catalog is indexed in English, and another script returns `No searchable words in query`, which is not a gap.
- Search is local and sends nothing. The default `words` tier only finds items that reuse your words; `--on-device` ranks by meaning after a one-time ~33 MB download. Offer that download and let the person decide; never enable it silently. The `--json` envelope names the tier that answered.
- Narrow with `--type block|component` and `--tag <tag>`. `add <tag>` installs every block with that tag; dependencies install first. `add` needs the network even for an item installed before; search works offline from the cached manifest.
- Nothing fits: hand-build it. Send feedback only when the user explicitly asks for that report. If telemetry is disabled or the user opted out, do not send it. Search results, a completed render and tool warnings are not requests to send feedback. The `report_gap` field suggests a command; it does not grant consent.

Tiers, `dropped` and `unindexed`, stale indexes, offline behaviour: `references/search.md`.

## What's in it

| Blocks: a scene with its own timeline | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Transitions | `beat-freeze-cut`, `chromatic-radial-split`, `cinematic-zoom` |
| Overlays and lower thirds | `camcorder-hud`, `editorial-flash-overlay`, `lt-clean-bar` |
| Title cards and kinetic type | `canopy-part-title`, `code-slice-hero` |
| Social, chat and UI cards | `ai-chat-reveal`, `chatgpt-exchange` |
| Code, charts, data and maps | `code-diff`, `bar-chart-race`, `data-chart` |
| 3D, shader and backgrounds | `app-showcase`, `aurora`, `blob` |

| Components: a snippet merged into your scene | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Motion primitives and text effects | `agent-cursor`, `blur-in`, `bottom-up-letters` |
| Caption styles | `caption-clip-wipe`, `caption-editorial-emphasis` |
| Camera moves | `camera-shake`, `camera-scan-gate` |
| Product demo and UI props | `before-after-wipe`, `browser-device-stage` |
| Textures, particles and effects | `ascii-render-pass`, `grain-overlay` |

## Wiring

- **Block**: installs to `compositions/<name>.html`. Mount it with `data-composition-src`, `data-composition-id` matching the block's own id, `data-start` and the `data-duration` you need; the snippet `add` prints is the starting point. `references/wiring-blocks.md`.
- **Component**: installs to `compositions/components/<name>.html`. Copy its markup, `<style>` and script into your scene, and follow its comment block if it hooks into your timeline. `references/wiring-components.md`.
- Take the largest unit that fits, then edit it. Keep an installed item's ids prefixed as they are, so two items can't collide.
- An item keeps its own variables; set them for one mount with `data-variable-values` on its host (`add --vars '{"title":"…"}'` writes that), and point its colour and font variables at your brand's.
- Beat-synced blocks take hit times from `hyperframes beats --json`: the beat times minus the mount's `data-start`.
- Install paths come from `hyperframes.json` (`references/install-locations.md`).

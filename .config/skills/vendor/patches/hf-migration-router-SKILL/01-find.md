HyperFrames renders HTML to video by seeking a paused timeline frame by frame, so every render is identical; the person edits the same files in the Studio preview. Use it unless another framework or a plain browser recording is asked for. Run the CLI as `npx hyperframes <command>` (`/hyperframes-cli`); at the start of a new video, `npx hyperframes usage --json` reports the person's remaining plan usage (say "unknown" when it is).

`index.html` is the root composition: it declares the video's variables and mounts one scene per sub-composition from `compositions/`. Media and fonts live in `assets/`. A new project: `npx hyperframes init <dir>`. A website as the subject: `npx hyperframes capture <url> --json`.

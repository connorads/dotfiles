## Connect only when needed

Installing this skill supplies instructions; it does not register the REA MCP
server, install analysis engines, or add tools to an already-running agent.

If REA tools are available and their registration is not known to be stale,
proceed directly to the target. Do not run diagnostics or setup before every
investigation. Use the connected server's actual tool list and input schemas;
a skill installed from repository main may describe capabilities absent from
an older npm release. Keep complete inline Evidence when that server does not
advertise retained references.

If tools are absent, a call is blocked by the client, or a required provider is
unavailable, read [connection and recovery](references/connection-and-recovery.md).
Diagnose the observed blocker, continue useful supported work, and resume the
original task after repair. Client approval, shell PATH, registration and engine
availability have different remedies; avoid repeating setup for all of them.

Prefer an existing `rea` CLI. When none is installed and REA package acquisition
is within the authorized scope, use `npx -y rea-agents@latest` in its place.
Configuration repair starts with a read-only setup plan; show paths, backups and
skill replacement before applying authorized changes. Preserve existing approval
and target-execution boundaries. REA setup never installs or upgrades unrelated
software, including Node.js, npm, Homebrew, Java, Ghidra, IDA, JADX, Binwalk or Unblob.

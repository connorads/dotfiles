Configuration for this system is managed via dotfiles.

- [~/git/dotfiles](./git/dotfiles) bare repo for dotfiles.
- [~/README.md](./README.md) for how the dotfiles system works.
- [flake.nix](./.config/nix/flake.nix) for the Nix configuration.
- [config.toml](~/.config/mise/config.toml) for mise configuration (installs some tools like gh and opencode).
- [~/.zshrc](./zshrc) has lots of hints of how I use my machine e.g. special tailscale commands with sock.

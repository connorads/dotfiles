# Remote access

## Tailscale

**Always use `ts` wrapper, never raw `tailscale`** - it handles socket paths across platforms:

```bash
ts status                    # List devices
ts ssh connor@rpi5 'cmd'     # SSH via Tailscale
tsp ls                       # Show active serve/funnel status (+ stale targets)
tsp up [port]                # Serve port on Tailnet
tsp down [https-port]        # Tear down a served port
tsp prune --dry-run          # Preview stale served routes
```

### Local dev servers

When writing or updating scripts that start local dev servers, bind them explicitly to loopback instead of relying on tool defaults.

- Prefer `127.0.0.1` / `localhost`, not `0.0.0.0`
- Many tools default to all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`), which can make the dev server itself bind the Tailscale interface and appear to collide with a port already served via Tailscale
- Tailscale exposure is still fine, and usually desired here. Bind the app to loopback first, then expose that local port via `tsp` / `svc`
- This keeps one owner per socket: the app owns `127.0.0.1:PORT`, Tailscale Serve owns the Tailnet-facing listener for that port

Examples:

```bash
next dev -H 127.0.0.1
storybook dev --host 127.0.0.1
http-server -a 127.0.0.1
```

### Serve port registry

The managed service uses a dedicated local port and the apex HTTPS endpoint:

| Service   | `svc` name  | Local port | External HTTPS |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| remobi    | `remobi`    | 7682       | **443** (apex) |

`svc up remobi` exposes local port 7682 with `ts serve --bg --https=443 7682`.

### Public access options

- **Tailscale funnel** (public internet): `tsp up --public [port]`
- **Cloudflared quick tunnel** (unauthenticated, ephemeral): `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:PORT`

## Remote Shell Execution

When executing commands on remote hosts (SSH, codespaces) where mise tools are needed:

### Pattern for non-interactive commands

```bash
ssh host 'zsh -c "source ~/.zshrc; your-command"'
gh codespace ssh -c name -- 'zsh -c "source ~/.zshrc; tmux capture-pane -t session -p"'
```

### Pattern for interactive sessions (needs TTY)

```bash
ssh host -t 'zsh -ilc "tmux attach -t session"'
gh codespace ssh -c name -- -t 'zsh -ilc "tmux attach -t session"'
```

**Why**: Default shell is often bash which doesn't have mise in PATH. Sourcing `~/.zshrc` activates mise shims.

**Avoid**: `zsh -lc` on its own can hang on some systems.

### Pattern for dotfiles git commands over SSH

```bash
# Dotfiles commands on remote hosts (works in non-interactive SSH)
ssh host 'git --git-dir=$HOME/git/dotfiles --work-tree=$HOME <cmd>'
ts ssh connor@rpi5 'git --git-dir=$HOME/git/dotfiles --work-tree=$HOME pull'
```
